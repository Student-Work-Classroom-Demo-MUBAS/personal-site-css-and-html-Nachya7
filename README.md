# Personal Portfolio Website
Showcases my skills, projects, background, resume and contacts.

Used google fonts to access fonts, aboxicons.com to apply social media-pages icons on my portfolio. Also used animations like hover, fade-ins and scrolling effect.

It was difficult researching a multitude of the things needed but eventually was able to find them. Also encountered a challenge on the project section to make all text visible, ended up using the scrolling effect.

All in all am excited that I was able to make the idea envisioned attainable. Have leant so much just by building this site.
